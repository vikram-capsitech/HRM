              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception
                in the 1950s. From early rule-based systems to modern machine
                learning and natural language processing (NLP), AI has evolved
                to understand and mimic human interactions with remarkable
                accuracy. In recruitment, AI began with simple resume-screening
                tools in the 1990s, filtering candidates based on keywords.
                Today, advanced AI systems, powered by deep learning and NLP,
                can conduct conversational interviews, assess candidate
                responses, and provide detailed analytics.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The development of large language models, like those powering
                Hirely, has enabled AI to engage in natural, human-like
                conversations, making interviews feel less robotic and more like
                a discussion with a seasoned recruiter. These advancements have
                transformed hiring by reducing bias, saving time, and improving
                candidate experiences.
